# Entanglement

In this experiment, pairs of photons are shown to exhibit polarization correlations that contradict classical expectations.

### Abstract

Linearly polarized photons produced by a 407~nm pump laser undergo Type-I Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC), facilitated by two Beta Barium Borate (BBO) crystals, yielding pairs of entangled 814~nm photons with correlated polarizations. These photons pass through polarizers, and coincidences are counted for varied polarization configurations. The number of coincidences determined for characteristic polarization configurations (+45, +45) and (+45, -45) differ from what are predicted classically.
