# Entanglement

In this experiment, pairs of polarization entangled photons are shown to violate the [CHSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHSH_inequality) inequality.

See report.pdf.

### Abstract

Linearly polarized photons produced by a 407nm pump laser undergo Type-I Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC), facilitated by two Beta Barium Borate (BBO) crystals, yielding pairs of entangled 814nm photons with correlated polarizations. These photons are passed through polarizers, and coincidences are counted for varied polarization configurations. A test of the CHSH Bell's inequality finds a violation by 8 standard deviations, with S = 2.56 +/- 0.07.
